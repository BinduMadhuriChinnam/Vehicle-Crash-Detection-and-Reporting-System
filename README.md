# Vehicle-Crash-Detection-and-Reporting-System

This project leverages the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm for real-time image and video-based road accident detection on highways. The system aims to enhance highway safety by enabling swift and accurate identification of accidents, facilitating prompt emergency response, and minimizing the impact of road incidents on public safety and infrastructure.

**🚧 Problem Statement**
Despite improvements in infrastructure and safety measures, highway accidents remain frequent and dangerous due to high speeds and heavy traffic. Manual and sensor-based detection systems suffer from delayed responses and limited coverage. There is a pressing need for automated, accurate, and rapid accident detection using visual data.

**🎯 Objectives**
Automatically detect road accidents using computer vision and deep learning.

Provide real-time alerts to emergency services and stakeholders.

Minimize response time and reduce traffic disruptions.

Optimize emergency resource allocation.

Support proactive measures for accident prevention.

**🧠 System Architecture**
The system is composed of the following modules:

Data Collection: Gathering highway images and videos from sources like public repositories and surveillance cameras.

Preprocessing: Standardizing data via resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

YOLO Implementation: Real-time object detection to identify accident-related events.

Training: Optimizing the YOLO model on labeled accident and non-accident data.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a real-world monitoring setup for continuous accident detection.
